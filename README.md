### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

My name is Tristan Oâ€™Neil. I have lived in Vermont almost my entire life and have worked remotely for the last 10+ years. I live with my wife, two
daughters and, a giant cat (heâ€™s a [Nebelung](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nebelung&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images)). In my free time, I enjoy running, mountain biking, and skiing. Professionally Iâ€™m energized by exploring new technologies and tools that improve developer experience/efficiency and have a passion for refactoring code.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was living in Washington DC for an internship at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org) I got [a little too close to a squirrel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEK2weXDowU)
